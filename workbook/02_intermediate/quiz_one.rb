#1. write a one-line program that creates 10 lines of the following: The Flintstones Rock!
  10.times { |index| puts "The Flintstones Rock!".rjust(21 + index) }

#2. Create a hash that expresses the frequency with which each letter occurs in this string:
  str = "The Flintstones Rock"
  #Example: {"F"=>1, "R"=>1, "T"=>1, "c"=>1, "e"=>2, ... }

  result = {}
  letters = ('A'..'Z').to_a.concat( ('a'..'z').to_a )
  letters.each do |letter|
    count = str.scan(letter.to_s).count
    result[letter] = count if count > 0
  end

  puts result

#3. The result of the following statement will be an error:
#puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2)
  str = "the value of 40 + 2 is"
  num = 40 + 2
  puts "#{str} #{num}"

  puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s

#4. What happens when we modify an array while we are iterating over it?
#What would be output by this code?
  ary = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ary.each do |item|
    p item
    ary.shift(1)
  end

  #result: skips 2 and 4
  1
  3

  ary = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ary.each do |item|
    p item
    ary.pop(1)
  end

  #result: removes 3 and 4
  1
  2

#5. Alan wrote the following method, which was intended to show all of the factors of the input number.
#How can you change the loop construct (instead of using begin/end/until) to make this work?
  while (dividend > 0) do
    divisors << number / dividend if number % dividend == 0
    dividend -= 1
  end

#6. Is there a difference between << and +
  Yes

#7. What's wrong with the Fibonacci calculator?

  def fib(first_num, second_num, limit=15)
  while second_num < limit
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
    second_num = sum
  end
  sum
  end

  result = fib(0,1)
  puts "result is #{result}"

#8. Write your own version of the rails titleize!
  str = "It's pointless arguing with you. You will be left to your own devices."
  puts str.split.map{ |one_word| one_word.downcase.capitalize }.join(' ')


#9. # Add a method to the Ruby String class that will take an input parameter and
# apply this form of shortening and return a shortened string with an ellipsis
# (but only when the string is too long to start with.)

# Once you have that done, use it to print out a table of this list of characters
# with no field larger than 32 characters in width.

#10. Augment the following hash such that it has additional key value pairs giving us a
#{}"demographic" key that has one of three values describing the age group
#the family member is in (kid, adult, senior):
